Reading through job descriptions can be tiring, with this tool you can get a quick 
estimation on the suitability of a job, tailored to your personal preferences. 
The longer you use the tool the more it learns about you and the more accurate its 
recommendations become.
<br>
<br>
Search for jobs in the ‘new jobs’ section, scrape their contents either one by one 
(faster) or all at once (slow), click on the job title to see if they’re any good 
and apply your vote, then transfer the job to your job vault so it can enter the 
training set. If the job is scraped you can get a prediction based on previous 
likes/dislikes. Once you have enough new jobs in the job vault hit ‘Retrain’ to 
generate a new prediction model.
