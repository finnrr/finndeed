I built this project to help me find a job. 
It scrapes the indeed.ca page for jobs based on your search, 
breaks down the job description into NLP terms, 
runs a regression analysis based on pervious upvote and down votes, 
stores the results in a sql database which is used to built the results page.

Most of the magic is in the app.py file.
